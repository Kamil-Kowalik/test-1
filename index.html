        <h4>Bob Dylan</h4>
        <p>
            Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me <br>
            I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to <br>
            Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me <br>
            In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
        </p>
        <p>
            Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand <br>
            Vanished from my hand <br>
            Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping <br>
            My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet <br>
            I have no one to meet <br>
            And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming
        </p>
        <p>
            Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me <br>
            I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to <br>
            Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me <br>
            In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
        </p>
        <p>
            Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship <br>
            My senses have been stripped <br>
            My hands can't feel to grip <br>
            My toes too numb toâ€¦ <br>
        </p>
